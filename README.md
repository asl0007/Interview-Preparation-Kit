# Solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview Book and Hackerrank IPK Section
Solutions are uploaded in .cpp or .py files, complete with write-ups commented at the top of each
file.

Write-ups contain the following sections, if applicable:
* Problem - a summary of the problem
* Time complexity - the big-O time complexity of the solution.
* Space complexity - the same as above, except for space instead of time.
